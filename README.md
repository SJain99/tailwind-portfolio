# Tailwind Portfolio
A portfolio website built using Tailwind CSS for my fourth-year web design class at Sheridan College. This was my first foray into using Tailwind for a full-fledged website and taught me a lot about the framework and it's utility and best practices. I will absolutely be using it for more websites in the future.

# Installation
To use the website, simply clone this repository onto your machine, navigate to the folder location, and open <code>index.html</code>.
